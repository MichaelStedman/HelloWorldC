## HelloWorldC
This is just a little project for me to learn some C, Git and GitHub.

#### Why learn C at the age of 60?
I've played with Clojure, Rust, Go and Python over the past year. I've also written C# on Linux Mint. None of them were particularly satisfactory experiences. Be it REPL, compile times, unit testing or debugging. None of them are as smooth as developing C# in Visual Studio running on Windows. I thought I'd go "back to basics" and give C a whirl.

#### Why use MinUnit?
Because it was only three lines of macro to get started. I didn't know enough C to get started with a more comprehensive unit testing framework. Perhaps that will be the focus of a future C project.

#### Why write a bunch of string handling functions?
1. The standard string functions in C are so dangerous! No wonder there are so many exploits.
2. Didn't have any betters ideas about what to write.
